The motivation to develop this app stemmed from efforts to learn Rails and the task of putting together an interesting "lightning talk". It introduces the concept of a 1D Cellular Automaton model and provides a web page in which you can develop and run such a model. There's nothing fancy here in terms of UI, but the app is fun to play with.
